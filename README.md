## 🎮 Introduction 
Media tracking tools have become essential for organising entertainment like anime and films, yet gaming still lacks a truly accessible and comprehensive solution. While existing solutions are out there, they come with drawbacks, such as paywalls or fragmented game listings.

XP Tracker was developed as an open-source Android application to fill this gap. Built with a Flutter frontend, Flask backend, and MySQL database, it offers a clean UI, powerful search, and a recommendation system powered by the IGDB API. This project was created as part of a final year university dissertation and focuses on usability, accessibility, and functionality for everyday gamers.
